# 📦 E-Commerce Database Project

## 🧠 Overview
This project is part of a database design challenge.  
We designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and built an e-commerce database from scratch using SQL.

The goal was to create a realistic database for managing products, brands, categories, sizes, variations, attributes, and images in an online store.
